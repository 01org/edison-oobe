<h1>Leaving One-time Setup</h1>

<div class='section'>
    <p>You have exited the one-time setup process without configuring WiFi network access. To return to the one-time
        setup process, hold down the 'RM' button on the device for over 5 seconds.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you may connect to the device via its serial interface and
