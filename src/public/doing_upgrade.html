<h1>Upgrade in progress...</h1>

<div class='section'>
    <p>Please do not disconnect the power or USB cables from your device for the next 5 minutes. Please use the
        serial connection to check when the device is done upgrading: it should have rebooted successfully
        and its hostname should have been reset to 'edison'.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>After the upgrade, press the button labeled 'RM' for over 5 seconds. Then, connect to the
    'edison_ap_[device serial number]' network and visit 'edison.local' in your browser. Alternatively,
    run 'configure_edison --setup' on the command-line.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Note: The data in all directories <b>except</b> '/home' and '/factory' will be deleted.</p>
